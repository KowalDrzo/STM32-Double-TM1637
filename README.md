# STM32-Double-TM1637
Library for two TM1637 displays. Tested on STM32 buepill with CubeMX and HAL.

Comments are in polish, but I can translate it to english. This is simply changed original TM1637 library for using with two displays (in my case red and blue).

Before compiling - change the Pin names to yours.

I suggest you to use it in CubeIde with HAL :)
